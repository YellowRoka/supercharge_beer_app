# supercharge_beer_app

A new Flutter homework for Supercharge

## App goal:

There are a lot of great beers out there… and to taste them all, we need a bucket list!

Your task is to design and develop a Flutter application, which displays beers one at a time and lets the users decide which one should be saved. After the selection the application lists out and shows details about the products.

To get all the content data you need, use Punk API v2 documentation[https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2] here.

## Requirements:

-	The application should connect to the Punk API and display its response on a user-friendly GUI.
-	The first screen should only show a single beer with some information and two buttons. With these two buttons, the users should be able to decide that they like the presented beer or not. This selection should be repeated ten times with ten random beers. You have to represent the query results with the beer’s image, name and its tagline.
-	After the tenth random beer,  the users should be able to see a list with all of their selected beers with their image and name. Additionally you can show some more information of your choice.
-	If you really want to impress us, create a detail screen, which can be reached by tapping the beer card on the selector screen and the selection list screen. The detail screen could show the beer’s name, image, description and some additional information.

## Thecnical requirements:

-	Your application should run at least on devices with Android 6.0 and iOS 15, and use at least Flutter 3
-	Web, Windows, macOS etc. support is not needed
-	Do not care about tablets.
-	You have to create a repository on GitLab and share with us.
-	You can use 3rd party libraries.

## Optional requirements:

-	Clean architecture
-	Dependency Injection
-	RxDart
-	Empty/error screens

## Time limit:
4 hour for this project.
